						<p id="mediump0">Design is a very important key point in our project. We used our knowledge from our Human Computer Interaction (HCI) module, as well as the design of the existing platform to design and create our mockup. Our plan is to start by taking a look at the existing design, structure our wireframe and propose it to our client, build the website skeleton, and implement the design.</p>

							<a href="#">Design Concept</a>
							<time class="col2" datetime="2014-01-01">Our platform is built based on the design principles of Visibility, Feedback, Affordance, Mapping, Consistency, and Constraints. We designed a skeleton of our platform and matched it with the existing design from our client. We want to present an attractive and minimalist design, which allows the user to make the most of the website's functionality and enjoy the user experience.</time>
							</div>
							<ul class="list l1">
								<li><b>Visibility</b><br>
									We made sure the pages display the necessary components of the functionality. For example, we set up all of the project details in one page and separated it from the Project Progress page, in order to create a great user flow. 
								</li>
								<li><b>Feedback</b><br>
									We want to maximize the user experience and improve the user flow from one page to another. For instance, when the student wants to edit a section of the progress page, a pop-up will appear which they can fill in. 
								</li>
								<li><b>Affordance</b><br>
									We are making sure that our platform provides obvious attributes within our design and are using common design concepts. For example, we are using colour indicators to show the task status (Red, Amber, Green) to display which tasks have major issues, minor issues and ehich tasks are going well.
								</li>
								<li><b>Mapping</b><br>
									Our design provides a smooth user control. The user will have confidence when interacting with our tool and will adapt with the user flow easily.
								</li>
								<li><b>Consistency</b><br>
									We have a strict rule about consistency within our design concept. We will make sure to have a red line on each page that matches the original template. The consistency on our design will make it easier for our client to learn and experience the platform.
								</li>
								<li><b>Constraints</b><br>
									We will make sure to deal with constraints within our system by limiting possible actions that can be performed. Testing will be conducted and consultancy with an experienced developer will also be done (our client).
								</li>

							<time class="col2" datetime="2014-01-01">We are building a wireframe of our project monitoring tool that will be used as part of the Project Placed platform. </time>
							</div>
							<p id="mediump0">The project monitoring tool will be a special feature within the Project Placed platform so we have to think of a design where the feature will match the original user interface. The main page consists of the project details featuring the description of the project, the client, technologies used and the project scope. The visibility of the project will be made based on the students who are building the platform, assigned TA, head supervisor, and the client representatives.</p>

							</video></center><br>
							<p id="mediump0">Within the main page, there will be a button available to view the ‘Project Progress’ page, where all of the our platform will be added. Project Progress consists of Main objectives and goals, the status of the project (marked with Green, Red, and Amber). The progress of each task, the leading team member, and the status of the task is also added). The student also has the ability to upload their schedule in the form of a gantt chart. In addition, they will be able to add thir current progress to update the supervisor and the client in the ‘Current Progress’ section.</p>
							<p id="mediump0">We have set up a bi-weekly submission form so all the bi-weekly reports are consistent. Students will be able to simply input the data with the name and the date automatically filled by the system. The user will be able to see the summary of each bi-weekly report and they will get a notification by email if anything is being uploaded. </p>
