						<p id="mediump0">Design is one of the most important key point in our project. We build the prototypes and design that matches with the existing platform and using our Humen Computer Interaction(HCI) knowledge at the same time. Our plan is to start from taking a look at the existing design, structure our wireframe and proposed it to our client, build the website skeleton and implement the design.</p>

							<a href="#">Design Concept</a>
							<time class="col2" datetime="2014-01-01">Our platform is built based on the design principles of Visibility, Feedback, Affordance, Mapping, Consistency, and Constraints. We design our platform skeleton and adjust it with the existing design from our client to present an attractive and minimalist design that allows user to be able to make the most of the website functionality and enjoy the user experience.</time>
							</div>
							<ul class="list l1">
								<li><b>Visibility</b><br>
									We make sure the pages displays necessary components of the functionality. For instance, we set up all of the project details in one page and separate it with the Project Progress page, in order to create a great user flow. 
								</li>
								<li><b>Feedback</b><br>
									We want to maximize the user experience and improve the user flow from one page to another. For instance, we are creating smooth button and necessary pop up functionality when needed.
								</li>
								<li><b>Affordance</b><br>
									We make sure our platform provides obvious attributes within our design and are using common design concept such as creating tasks status using colour indicator (Green, Amber, Red) to display which tasks are major issues, minor issues and tasks that go well.
								</li>
								<li><b>Mapping</b><br>
									Our design provides a smooth user control. The user will have confidence when interacting with our tool and adapt with the user flow easily.
								</li>
								<li><b>Consistency</b><br>
									We have a strict rule about consistency within our design concept. We make sure to have a red line on each page that matches the original template. The consistency on our design makes it easier for our client to learn and experience the platform.
								</li>
								<li><b>Constraints</b><br>
									We make sure to deal with constraints within our system by limiting possible actions that can be performed. Testing will be conducted and consultancy with experienced developer will also be done (our client).

							<time class="col2" datetime="2014-01-01">We are building a wireframe of our communication management tool that will be used as part of Project Placed platform. </time>
							</div>
							<p id="mediump0">The communication management tool will be a special feature within the Project Placed platform so we have to think of a design where the feature will match the original User Interface. The main page consists of the project details featuring the description of the project, the client, technologies used and the project scope. The security of the platform will be made based on the students who are building the platform, assigned TA, head supervisor, and the client representatives.</p>

							<p id="mediump0">Within the main page, there will be a button available to track the ‘Project Progress’ where all of the core platform will be added. Project Progress consists of Main objectives and goals, the status of the project (marked with Green, Red, and Amber to mark priorities). The progress of the task is also added with the list of lead team member and the status of the task. We are creating a Gantt chart additional feature as well to display the progress of the project. Students will be able to add Current Progress to update the supervisor and the client in ‘Current Progress’ section.</p>
							<p id="mediump0">We have set up a bi-weekly submission form so all the bi-weekly reports are uniform. Students will be able to simply input the data with the name and the date automatically filled by the system. User will be able to see the summary of each bi-weekly report and they will get a notification by email if anything is being uploaded. </p>
