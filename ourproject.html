							<p id="biggerp">With many choices of communication technology nowadays, it’s hard to manage everything in one place. The variation and number of these platforms being used by students is what can make it difficult to track the communication effectively. We looked at how we can develop a solution to keep track of communication between students and their client or supervisor. </p>

							<p id="biggerp">Our challenge is to create a cutting edge tool that:
								</p><ul class="list l1">
									<li>Provides a robust and easy to use platform to gather information about the project from students and allow the client/supervisor to monitor this activity.</li>
									<li>is suitable with the existing platform.</li>

							<p id="biggerp">As a team our challenges are to:</p>
								<ul class="list l1">
									<li>collaborate with the other team and the client.</li>
									<li>distribute the work (technical and non technical) within the team.</li>
									<li>manage our timetable to finish the project on time.</li>
								</ul><br>
								<p id="biggerp">In order to be successful with this project, we have to meet some challenging requirements. Our paramount target is to create a good relationship with the client and make sure that our platform is the result of their initial idea in the first place. We want to create a robust and functional platform with a smooth and attractive user interface as it would draw more users (our target user is university students).

						<p id="biggerp">Differences to initial requirements:
							<p id="biggerp">There have been some differences in the design of our platform since we made the first initial requirements. Firstly, we were told by our client that it would be alright to make a standalone project which they could use in the future. Therefore, we did not have to worry about integrating our pages with theirs. As well as that, the schedule page we had in our original mockups has been replaced with a Gantt chart page, and the functionality has been modified. We removed a section on the main page where the students entered an overview of their project and how their project was doing. We decided that this section was redundant as the biweekly section had the same functionality. Also we didn't implement notifications. At the moment, the initial platform is still in it's initial design stage, but we think implementing notifications is an important factor that should definitely be implemented in the future.</p>
