						<h2 class="head1">Differences to initial requirements</h2>
						<div id="mediump0">here have been some differences in the design of our platform since we made the first initial requirements. Firstly, we were told by our client that it would be alright to make a standalone project which they could use in the future. Therefore, we did not have to worry about integrating our pages with theirs. As well as that, the schedule page we had in our original mockups has been replaced with a Gantt chart page, and the functionality has been modified. We removed a section on the main page where the students entered an overview of their project and how their project was doing. We decided that this section was redundant as the biweekly section had the same functionality. Also we didn't implement notifications. At the moment, the initial platform is still in it's initial design stage, but we think implementing notifications is an important factor that should definitely be implemented in the future.</div>

					<div id="mediump0">We used the Ionic Framework and AngularJS for the frontend of the platform, then Django for the backend. These are the tools that the initial platform has been using, and one of our aims was to use the same tools to keep our code consistent with the initial designs. Our goal was to make a platform that could be plugged into the platform in the future.</div>

					<h2 class="head1">AngularJS</h2>
					<div id="mediump0"><img style="width:12%;height:12%" src="images/angular.png">We have been using AngularJS alongside the usual HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend of the platform. AngularJS lets us extend the HTML vocabulary, and has many additional features including: directives, expressions, filters, modules, and controllers. Using AngularJS allows us to make a more dynamic web application.</div>

					<div id="mediump0"><img style="width:10%;height:10%" src="images/ionic2.png">Ionic is a open source framework which builds upon AngularJS. Although it is an SDK for developing mobile applications, we are making use of its library of of UI components, layouts, and tools to create an interactive web application that is also visually appealing. We believe it will also make it easier for the page to be fully phone compatible in the future.</div>

							<a id="designpattern">Django Design</a>
							</div>
							<h2 class="head1">Model View Controller Design Pattern</h2>
							<div id="mediump0">Django slightly follows the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This design pattern helps to divide the application into three connected parts which are independent from each other. The first part of the MVC architecture is the Model, which performs business logic (It accesses the database and fetches data). The second part is the View, which displays the model, producing output. The last part is the Controller, which receives and handles a request from the view and updates the model appropriately, depending on the input from the user. We say "slightly follows" as Django has some differences to the usual architecture. As explained in their FAQ page, (<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/faq/">Link to Django FAQ</a>), what is normally descibed as the "controller" is actually the Django views, and what is normally described as the "view" is actually Django's template system. The Django views describe which data is presented to the user, and pass that to the template which describes how that data is presented. "Model-View-Template archtecture" is often used instead to better describe Django's behaviour.</div>						
							<br>
							<h2 class="head1">Django Philosophies</h2>
							<div id="mediump0">The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) philosophy is a fundamental concept in Django. It is all about keeping the code simple and reducing repetition as much as possible. By following the MVC architecture explained above, we have also been following the DRY philosophy to a certain degree. Controller code is kept separately from views and multiple controllers can use the same view.</div>	
							<br>
							<div id="mediump0">
							One philosophy is that Models should include all relevant domain level logic - "Following Martin Fowler's Active Record design pattern, models should encapsulate every aspect of an object". The models we have created not only define the actual data in the model class, but also information about the model. We return a human-readable representation of each model using the __str__ method. This made it easier to handle model instances and test models using Django's QuerySet API.
							<br><a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html" style="color: #CC0000">Martin Fowler's Active Record design pattern</a>
							<br><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/models/querysets/" style="color: #CC0000">Django QuerySet API reference</a>
							<br><br>
							<div id="mediump0">
							In our code, we are using Django's database API and do not rely on importing other modules or helper objects. Following some of their advice on their database optimisation page, we get items from the database by writing queries which use the item's index (rather than the name for example). We also try not to make unecessary queries.
							<br><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/db/optimization/" style="color: #CC0000">Django Database Optimization</a>
							<br><br>
							<div id="mediump0">
							With regards to templates, Django's template system is a tool to control presentation and presentation-related logic. In our project, we have created the frontend using AngularJS and Ionic, then integrated it with Django's template system as best as we could. We also had a look at Django's templete inheritance, but we found we didn't require it as we didn't have any elements that would remain across all templates (even the header was modified slightly each time).
